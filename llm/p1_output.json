    "notes": "At the first leaf stage (early seedling),iceberg lettuce thrives in cool temperatures ideally between 15-21°C during the day and 10-15°C at night to avoid bolting and bitterness.  Relative humidity around 50-70% supports healthy growth without promoting disease.  Light intensity of 150-250 µmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ PPFD with a daily light integral (DLI) of 8-12 mol·m⁻²·day⁻¹ optimizes photosynthesis for leaf expansion.  Seedlings are sensitive to temperature stress;  temperatures below 10°C can slow growth, while above 24°C risks early bolting.  Providing 4-6 hours of direct or bright indirect light is beneficial.  Nutrient uptake is moderate but requires adequate organic matter or starter fertilizer.  Thinning seedlings to maintain spacing (~6 inches) is recommended to prevent overcrowding and ensure vigor.  CO2 enrichment is generally not critical at this stage but can enhance growth in controlled environments."
